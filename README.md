### Python Implementation of Relational Quantum Dynamics

This implements Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD) in Python. While it provides a starting point. Python has limitations for quantum simulations due to slow performance due to interpretation. 

For a more robust and faster implementation, see the RQD implementation in Julia at [https://github.com/dev-aditya/Relational_Quantum_Dynamics](https://github.com/dev-aditya/Relational_Quantum_Dynamics).
